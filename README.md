# Lean-Six-Sigma-Case-Study---Gentech

# Introduction
Gentech, a multinational company with a $60 billion annual revenue, faced an 18% reduction in the last two years. Tasked by CEO Elliot Smith, the VP of supply chain operations, Grace Monroe, initiated a Lean Six Sigma project led by Jeff Hugh to streamline the proposal creation process, aiming to reduce the cycle time by 15%. This case study presents the journey from problem identification to solutions implementation.

# Objective
The project aimed to identify and address bottlenecks and inefficiencies in Gentech's proposal creation process using Lean Six Sigma methodologies. The primary objective was to streamline operations, reduce cycle time, and regain Gentech's competitive edge by implementing a comprehensive framework. The goal included achieving an approximate 20% reduction in overall cycle time, generating potential revenue of $830 million per year.

# Dataset
The project utilized a comprehensive dataset encompassing multiple dimensions such as year, geography, seller, brand, month, and various timestamps representing different stages of the proposal creation process. Additional feedback columns captured seller and BSS sentiments, bid size, and specific issues encountered during the process.

#  Conclusion
The Lean Six Sigma project provided valuable insights into Gentech's proposal creation process, enabling the identification of key areas for improvement. By implementing targeted solutions, Gentech aimed to reduce cycle time, enhance operational efficiency, and ultimately regain its competitive edge in the market. The tools and methodologies employed ensured a systematic and data-driven approach to problem-solving and process optimization.
